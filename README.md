# Avalanche Prediction with CNNs: Comprehensive Analysis and Flow Visualization

## Purpose

This repository contains the code for predicting avalanches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The primary goal of this project is to analyze video sequences to detect potential avalanche events accurately. This project includes comprehensive analysis and flow visualization to enhance the prediction accuracy and provide detailed insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model consists of 20 videos, which can be accessed via the following link:

## Features

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Utilizes CNNs for feature extraction and classification.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides detailed analysis of the model's performance.
- **Flow Visualization**: Includes visualizations to understand the flow and prediction results.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Avalanche-Prediction-with-CNNs-Comprehensive-Analysis-and-Flow-Visualization.git
   cd Avalanche-Prediction-with-CNNs-Comprehensive-Analysis-and-Flow-Visualization
   ```

2. **Access the dataset:**
   Download the dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y-HHVxCSZULgJ__JpysVjMB5-flKfYzA?usp=drive_link) and place the videos in the appropriate directory as specified in the Colab notebook.

3. **Run the code:**
   Open the [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Gr6mL-wcnT5R90I4DFyTRe4_LQUe9vJl?usp=sharing) and follow the instructions to execute the code. Ensure that you have access to the dataset as the notebook will load and process the videos for training and evaluation.

## Requirements

The primary environment for running the code is Google Colab, which already has most dependencies installed. However, if running locally, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```
